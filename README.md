###KeyLager

KeyLager is a basic keylogger made in Python. It takes note of every key that gets pressed once activated on a system.
The main use of this keylogger is to be used in small sized Red Teaming operation, Capture the Flag challenges
and other non-malicious operations where you might need a keylogger. 
In the near future the functionalities of this script will be expanded to make it more useful for its intended purposes.
